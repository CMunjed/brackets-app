## Project Description
This project will be utilizing Angular for the frontend and Golang for the backend. <br /><br />
This tool is an online tournament bracket creation tool that can be used to facilitate the ease of use in bracket generation. <br />
The goal is to create a user friendly bracket because most brackets we that are used are set upon creation and are hard to use. <br />
We want to make it easy for the user to create a adjustable bracket which is lacking in most functionality of others, a bracket that can be created based on inserted values/stats. <br />
Also allow the use of randomizing the brackets. Different Formated brackets types (ex. two way, one way, etc.). And maybe the possiblity of merging brackets.
