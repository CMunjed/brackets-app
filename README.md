# brackets-app
This is our brackets app for CEN3031 Intro to Software Engineering Spring 2023 @ UF.

## Project Description
This is an online tournament bracket creation tool with an emphasis on flexibility, customizability, and ease of use. <br /><br />

The goal is to create a product that is more user-friendly and intuitive than existing alternatives. For example, this tool will allow modification of existing brackets, a feature which is surprisingly scarce among alternatives. We plan to include a wide range of functionality, including a large selection of tournament styles such as single elimination, double elimination, round robin, etc., the ability to input, change, and customize contestant information and bracket configurations, the ability to merge existing brackets, the ability to randomize/shuffle brackets, and more.<br /><br />

This tool will utilize Angular for the front-end and Go for the back-end.
